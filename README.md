### What I learned

In this project i had to use react and styled component for the first time. this was a new challenge for me, the logic and specificity of which is different from JavaScript. based on the specifics of React, i learned how to use usestate and how to import functions into the main App.jsx file to finally display our results onscreen. It was also new for me to use css frameworks, namely the styled component, where one of the differences was the syntax, for example, in default css, you write css code in a separate css file or within <style> tags in the HTML document. in styled components, you write the styles in javascript code using a special syntax that allows you to create css rules using tagged template literals.
